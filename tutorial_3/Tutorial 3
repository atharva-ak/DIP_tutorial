Q1. Take a image, find it's DFT (frequency transform and maganitude).
Q2. Remove the low frequencies(HPF) for above image and generate image again through inverse DFT.
Q3. Perform DWT over given image and find different detailed structures. (Study PyWavelets library)
Q4. Using KLT algorithm, (a) Observe features which are useful (b) Track motion of moving body from video.
